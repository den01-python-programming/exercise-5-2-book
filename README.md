# Exercise 5.2 Book

Create a "Book" class that describes a book. Each book has an author, title, and page count.

Make the class a:

- Constructor `def __init__(self, author, name, pages)`
- Method `def get_author()` that returns the book's author's name.
- Method `def get_name()` that returns the name of the book.
- Method `def get_pages()` that returns the number of pages in the book.

In addition, make a `def __str__()` method for the book that will be used to print the book object. For example, the method call should produce the following output:

```plaintext
J. K. Rowling, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, 223 pages
```
